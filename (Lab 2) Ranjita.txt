1. WAP for creating a mini calculator for performing a particular operation based on user choice. ex. if the 
user will select the addition operation then the output should be the addition of the given two nos.

1.--->
package com.demo;

public class MiniCalculator 
{

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		double num1 = 15;
        double num2 = 3;
        
        System.out.println("Welcome to the Mini Calculator!!!");
        System.out.println("---------------------------------");
        
        // Perform addition
        double sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("Addition: " + num1 + " + " + num2 + " = " + sum);
        
        // Perform subtraction
        double difference = num1 - num2;
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + num1 + " - " + num2 + " = " + difference);
        
        // Perform multiplication
        double product = num1 * num2;
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + num1 + " * " + num2 + " = " + product);
        
        // Perform division
        if (num2 != 0) {
            double quotient = num1 / num2;
            System.out.println("Division: " + num1 + " / " + num2 + " = " + quotient);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division: Cannot divide by zero");
        }
	}
}

Output:
	
Welcome to the Mini Calculator!!!
---------------------------------
Addition: 15.0 + 3.0 = 18.0
Subtraction: 15.0 - 3.0 = 12.0
Multiplication: 15.0 * 3.0 = 45.0
Division: 15.0 / 3.0 = 5.0



2. WAP for creating a banking Application .you have to take input from the user whether the user wants
   to deposit, withdraw, or find a currentÂ balance.

2.--->
package com.demo;

import java.util.*;

public class BankingApplication {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        double balance = 1000.0; // Initial balance
        
        System.out.println("\n---- Banking Application ----");

        while (true) {
            System.out.println("\nWhat do you want to do?");
            System.out.println("1. Deposit");
            System.out.println("2. Withdraw");
            System.out.println("3. Check Balance");
            System.out.println("4. Exit");
            System.out.print("Enter your choice (1-4): ");

            int choice = scanner.nextInt();

            switch (choice) {
                case 1: // Deposit
                    System.out.print("Enter amount to deposit: ");
                    double depositAmount = scanner.nextDouble();
                    balance = balance + depositAmount; 
                    System.out.println("Amount deposited successfully.");
                    break;

                case 2: // Withdraw
                    System.out.print("Enter amount to withdraw: ");
                    double withdrawAmount = scanner.nextDouble();
                    if (withdrawAmount <= balance) {
                        balance = balance - withdrawAmount; 
                        System.out.println("Amount withdrawn successfully.");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("Insufficient balance.");
                    }
                    break;

                case 3: // Check Balance
                    System.out.println("Your current balance is: " + balance);
                    break;

                case 4: // Exit
                    System.out.println("Exiting the application.");
                    System.out.println("Thank you for using the banking application!");
                    scanner.close(); 
                    System.exit(0); 

                default:
                    System.out.println("Invalid choice. Please try again.");
            }
        }
    }
}
